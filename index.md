Event+ An AWS Based Event Recommendation Web Service

[See Project](http://18.191.160.215/Jupiter)

Analyzed multiple recommendation systems and designed a user-based & content-based algorithm for event recommendation based on usersâ€™ location and saved favorite events 

- Designed an interactive web application for users to search for local events (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX)
- Implemented RESTful APIs using Java Servlets to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Built MySQL database from TicketMaster API to retrieve event information
- Designed algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) based on geo-location to implement event recommendation 
- Deployed the Apache Tomcat web service to AWS EC2 VM for better performance

Around A Geo-index Based Social Network

- Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GAE flex) for better scaling
- Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)
- Used Google Dataflow to implement a daily dump of posts to BigQuery table for offline analysis
- Aggregated the data at the post level and user level to improve the keyword based spam detection (BigQuery)
