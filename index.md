Around A Geo-index Based Social Network

- Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GAE flex) for better scaling
- Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)
- Used Google Dataflow to implement a daily dump of posts to BigQuery table for offline analysis
- Aggregated the data at the post level and user level to improve the keyword based spam detection (BigQuery)
