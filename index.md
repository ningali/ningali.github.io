### PROJECTS

Event+ 

An AWS Based Event Recommendation Web Service
[See Project](http://18.191.160.215/Jupiter)

Analyzed multiple recommendation systems and designed a user-based & content-based algorithm for event recommendation based on usersâ€™ location and saved favorite events

- Developed java servlets with Restful API to handle HTTP request and responses
- Retrieved event information with TicketMaster API for key word extraction from event descriptions
- Transformed and stored the event info (event name, date, location, etc) into MySQL database and deployed it to Amazon RDS for scalability and simplicity
- Deployed to Amazon EC2 for better performance
